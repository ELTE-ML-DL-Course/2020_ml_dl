    "Train a classification model on the MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of $28\\times 28$ grayscale images of handwritten digits. Try to achieve at least $95\\%$ accuracy on the test set (this should not be hard). Try to achieve even higher accuracy, say $99\\%$ (this is not hard either). Actually, the MNIST dataset is considered as a too easy problem, since even the most basic classification algorithms can achieve very high precision. Still, it is a good opportunity to play around with various network architectures (fully connected layers and/or convolutional layers) and hyperparameters (number of hidden layers, number of units, regularization types and their parameters, various activation functions, etc.)\n",
