This course provides a practical introduction to the field of Machine Learning and one of its subfield, Deep Learning, a representation learning method, that has become the most dominant approach for many machine learning tasks in the past years.

It has been successfully applied to problems in computer vision (image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, self-driving cars) and sequence modeling (natural language processing, speech recognition, image caption generation, machine translation) where the input data is unstructured and typically have a large volume. It also has applications in drug discovery, bioinformatics, medical image analysis and diagnosis, image restoration, and many other fields.

This course requires at least an intermediate Python knowledge: be confident with the syntax and programming concepts and have experience in using the Python scientific libraries, particularly NumPy. Check the links below for tutorials. We will use the Tensorflow/Keras deep learning framework (Tensorflow 2.2) for the coursework.

Given a content image and a style reference image

we can blend them together so the output image looks like the content image, but "painted" in the style of the  reference image.
